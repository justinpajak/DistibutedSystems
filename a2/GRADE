------------------
-5 Your system works, but the performance is several orders of magnitude slower than expected.
It should be possible to service several thousand requests per second.
It isn't immediately obvious to me why your code is slow, but here are some possibilities:
- Are you making a new TCP connection for every request?  (Just keep one open.)
- Do you have a lot of debug output on every request?  (Remove unneeded output.)
(Frankly, I have reviewed your codes and checked for these two possibilities, yet found nothing. Maybe I missed something. Sorry for that, but you'll have to work on it.)
Please troubleshoot your performance before submitting the next assignment.
