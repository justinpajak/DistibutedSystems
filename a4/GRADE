Assignment 4 - Concurrency and Discovery

Basic Operation (40 points)
---------------------------

Server Code Details (20 points)
-------------------------------
HashTableServer.py looks ok.

Client Code Details (10 points)
-------------------------------
HashTableClient.py looks ok.

Report (30 points)
------------------
-2 Missing indidvidual data for multiple clients.
-3 Missing discussion: the *sum* of insert throughput should not increase dramatically with the number of clients, because the bottleneck is the handling of the log.
-3 Missing discussion: the *sum* of lookup performance should increase with the number of clients, because the server is now able to overlap requests/responses between clients.
